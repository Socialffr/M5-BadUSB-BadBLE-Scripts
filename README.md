## Ima Explaine The Scripts Here!

Script 1 (Bootfucker.txt)
A bootfucker is a type of executable file (like an .exe) specifically made 2 wreck ur bootloader, which is da lil program ur system runs 2 load up da OS (Windows, Linux, etc.). When u run a bootfucker, it goes full savage, overwriting or deleting critical bootloader files like GRUB, EFI data, or MBR (Master Boot Record). Dis means ur PC can’t find da OS, so it either gets stuck in a bootloop, throws up error screens like “No Bootable Device,” or just fully bricks.








Bootfuckers don’t play it Once it hits, u basically need pro skills or repair tools 2 fix da bootloader, reinstall ur OS, or even wipe ur drive. Fr, they’re not just a pain—they can end ur whole setup if ur not careful lol.
